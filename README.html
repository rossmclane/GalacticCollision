    <h1> galaxyCollision </h1>
      <p> This is a simulation of galaxy collisions! I have used Eulerian Integration to time step the N-bodies in the simulation and the Barnes-Hut Algorithm to optimize the time complexity of the N-body problem. A typical N-body problem is O(N^2), but with the Barnes-Hut Algorithm the complexity is O(Nlog(N)), allowing for many more bodies and a more realistic galactic collision </p>

    <h3> Barnes-Hut Algorithm </h3>
    <p> The Barnes-Hut Algorithm is a clever scheme to group bodies that are close together and treat them as a single center of mass in order to make force calculations less intensive. It recursively divides the bodies in your system into groups by sorting them into a quad tree (like a binary tree, but with four child nodes instead of two). Each node in the Quad Tree represents a region in 2-Dimensional space. Below is a depiction of these Quadrants with bodies in them. "External Quadrants" are those that only have a single body in them. "Internal Quadrants are those quadrants that refer to other quadrants, which may or may not have bodies in them.</p>

      <li> Objects File - This file defines the Body and Cell Classes. A Body object is a mass in the N-body system. A Cell object represents a quadrant in 2 dimensional space. It has the ability to self divide into child quadrants and populate itself with Body objects. </li>
      <li> Tree File - This file defines the Tree object, which has an "advance" method that populates all of the cells with bodies, calculates the net forces on each body according to the Barnes-Hut Algorithm and steps each body through time.</li>
      <li> Initialize File - This file sets the initial conditions for the bodies in the system. Currently, this simply initializes two black holes within the universe and uniformly distributes masses in a disk around them. There is no distribution of masses throughout the galaxy, each mass is simply a solar mass and the black holes are 4 million times a solar mass. The is initial rotational velocity of masses around the Black Holes, but no initial velocity of the galaxy itself. </li>
      <li> Driver File - This file runs the simulation for some duration and will eventually write the position output to a CSV file and animate the process</li>
