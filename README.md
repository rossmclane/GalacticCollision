    <h1> galaxyCollision </h1>
      <p> This is a simulation of galaxy collisions! I have used Eulerian Integration to time step the N-bodies in the simulation and the Barnes-Hut Algorithm to optimize the time complexity of the N-body problem. A typical N-body problem is O(N^2), but with the Barnes-Hut Algorithm the complexity is O(Nlog(N)), allowing for many more bodies and a more realistic galactic collision </p>
